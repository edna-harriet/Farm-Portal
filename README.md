# Farm-Portal - Backend
Portal of agriculture activities and services that explains to users steps to follow on accessing and using different modules and functionalities of the system.

In this backend application I developed a transaction management application in order to get practice with javascript,CSS,html together with PHP's codeigniter framework including the use of a MySQL database. This application allows the storage of farm inputs,outputs processes whilst capturing the incomes and outcomes financial transactions and allow the registration and listing of those transactions, in addition to allowing the creation of new records in the database by sending a csv file.
